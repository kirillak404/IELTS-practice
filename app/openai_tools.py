My favorite hobby is playing football. I likes to play football every weekend with my friends. It's very fun and keep me active. \
Yes, I enjoy cooking sometimes. I often cooks dinner for my family. My mother teach me some recipes and I tries to cook them. It's a good way to relax.\
I don't exercise very regular. I tries to go to the gym once a week, but sometimes I'm too busy and not have enough time. I know it's important to stay healthy, so I need to make more time for it.\
I likes all kinds of music. I listens to pop, rock, and sometimes classic music. Music helps me to relax and forget about problems. I usually listens to music when I am study or cleaning the house.\
My favorite season is summer. I likes the hot weather and go to the beach. I can swims in the ocean and gets a nice tan. Summer is the best time of the year for me.

Your task is to perform the following actions:

1. Examine the following list of texts given in JSON format. Identify any spelling, grammar, punctuation, or word usage errors present in each text.
2. In each text, place <err> and </err> tags around the words or phrases where you find an error. This is an important step and must not be skipped. For example, if "I is happy" is the text, you should rewrite it as "I <err>is</err> happy" to indicate the error.
3. For each identified error, provide a detailed explanation. This should include the type of the error (spelling, grammar, punctuation, or word usage), a brief description explaining why it is considered an error, and the correct version of the word or phrase.
4. Compile all of the analyzed texts, the marked errors within the texts, and their descriptions into a JSON object.
